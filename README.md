## Future Enhancements

- Add an add to cart window separate from the rest of the page for the user to view items that they want to purchasefor later

- Find a way to sort items by type, owner, or availability

- Further refinement of the styling on the page and showing the user that items have been purchased

### Pseudo-Coding

- Add add to cart button

- use DOM manipulation to give the items added to cart a new class class="inCart"

- add checkout button similar to a buy edit button that changes the isPurchased value in the mongoDB document

- once isPurchased = true use flounder tags to add a new class to items that have been purchased to indicate they are no longer needed to be bought
