### Pseudo-Coding

- Add add to cart button

- use DOM manipulation to give the items added to cart a new class class="inCart"

- add checkout button similar to a buy edit button that changes the isPurchased value in the mongoDB document

- once isPurchased = true use flounder tags to add a new class to items that have been purchased to indicate they are no longer needed to be bought
